# textAnnotator
Simple web application for easily annotating text files for e.g. classification tasks.

# Usage
Open *main.html* in your browser (only tested in chrome) and follow the instructions.

Text is highlighted as soon it is selected with the mouse, and easily removed by clicking on a highlight. 

You can import any text file, but you should format the text with html to get a readable layout.
